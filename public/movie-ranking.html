<h3>Spiderman No Way Home</h3>
<p>Number one film, I love the collaboration of all three Spidermans</p>

<h3>Harry Potter amd the Order of the Phoenix</h3>
<p>Hard to pick a favourite Harry Potter but it would probably be this one</p>

<h3>The Persuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>Absolutely beautiful film, incredibly motivating too. Will Smith is great!</p>
